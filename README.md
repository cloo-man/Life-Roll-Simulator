# ðŸŽ² Life Roll Simulator

This is a small browser-based simulator that generates a random **life outcome** based on historical-inspired rules. 
It was designed for role-playing and world-building â€” one click gives you a characterâ€™s gender, survival odds, death age, and possible children.

## Features
- Fully random rolls each time
- Uses historical survival odds:
  - Infancy survival
  - Childhood survival
  - Adulthood lifespan brackets
- Determines number of children with a fertility cap
- Assigns birth years for children within the parentâ€™s fertile window
- **Single-result mode**: each click replaces the previous roll

## How to Use
1. Open [the live site](https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/life-roll-simulator/) 
   *(Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.)*
2. Click **ðŸŽ² Roll Character**.
